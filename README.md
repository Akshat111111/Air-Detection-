# Air-Detection-
Air quality Tracker Application 

This is a  Pollution Detector Web application. Here are some steps to help you with your task


This web application has a search bar that takes in the values for City, State, and Country. When the user enters the values and clicks on
the Search button, an API call is made to get the Air Quality Index (AQI) for the entered location.

The AQI data can be displayed on the webpage, along with the concern level. The concern level can be calculated based on the AQI value and
the corresponding color can be used to display the concern level.

The webpage has a section that displays the major pollutants and their names. You can use the AQICN API to get the pollutant data.

This application is minimalistic in terms of design and can be easily implemented.
